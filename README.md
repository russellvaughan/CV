## Russell Vaughan

I'm a half Canadian, half English, half set of twins who doesn't do things by halves. After a career in media and sales I've made the decision to embrace my lifelong passion for technology and begin a career in software development. I have always had a love affair with helping business grow and develop. I've been a part of multiple teams who have launched products and revenue streams from nothing to become seven figure businesses. This year, I'd like to find a company where I can help a company grow and develop in a new way. I'm looking for an environment where, through hard work and a commitment to learning, I can now grow as a junior developer

## Skills

#### New Business Development

I love new business. I think I love it more than old business. I probably should love them equally but the heart doesn't lie and I have a preference for the former. Having an impact on companies through the work I do for them is something that is really important to me. Bringing new clients on board was a very tangible way to demonstrate that. There is also something incredibly exciting about learning about new businesses and seeing if there is anything you are able to offer that can help them solve problems. There are also no real shortcuts to finding new business, you have to work hard and get out and find it.

- As an individual, I have brought numerous new major advertising clients on board notably the likes of GSK, Mars and Fiat.
- The honest reality is that the biggest jobs require a team effort and I was extremely proud to be part of team took BT from a non spender to a multimillon pound advertiser.
- I was also part of a team that launched Dax, a new digital audio advertising network in the UK. In its first year dax acheived 75% market awareness and over £1m in advertising revenues. 
- Previously to my media work, I joined a startup recruitment company with 5 employess and $100,000 a year revenues and in just over a year, we scaled that to a 20 person company with $1.4m in revenues.

#### Compulsive Coder

I would describe myself as a greedy coder. If the world of computer programming were a restaurant, I'd want it to be an all you can eat buffet. I love immersing myself in new languages and find if you put the work in you can get incredible results in a relatively short period of time. 

- In just under two weeks, I built a music streaming service with a Angular frontend and rails API.

- In one week, I managed to build a web app that uses the GitHub API to search through its users. This was all done on a new framework     and language with AngularJs

- In two (pretty intensive) days, I built a replica Instagram in Ruby on Rails

#### Managment Experience.

I was realtively new to the world of management but really enjoyed it. I have had the responsbility for weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting to senior management teams. I've also been a part of annual volume/share deal negoations and have been responsible for their managment and implemetation. Further to this, I have also been responsbile for my teams annual performance reviews. I have always been lucky throughout my career to have mentors and people who have helped me grow and develop. When I moved into management I felt the responsiblity to pass that on to my team. One of my favourite aspects of management was being able to help people on my team to learn and progress. I think a big part of that was through setting expectations, honest feedback and listening to their ambitions and goals.

- By setting up best practice systems and process I was able to increase revenue visability for forecasting significantly each month.
- The team as a whole performed exceptionally well with collective revenue finishing up 11% YOY.
- I was extremely proud to have three of my direct reports promoted while working for me.

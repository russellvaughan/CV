## Russell Vaughan

I am half English, half Canadian, and one half of a set of twins - but I don't do things by halves.  After a 13 year career in media and sales, I have made the decision to embrace my lifelong passion for technology and pursue a future in software development.  I am extremely proud of my background and have always had a love affair with helping business grow and develop - however, in software development I have discovered a desire to truly excel.  I am seeking a role in which I can contribute to the development of a company in a new way - where I can grow as a Junior Developer through hard work and commitment to learning

## Skills

#### Compulsive Coder

I would describe myself as a greedy coder. If the world of computer programming were a restaurant, I'd want it to be an all you can eat buffet. I love immersing myself in new languages and find if you put the work in you can get incredible results in a relatively short period of time. 


| Project Description        |    Link        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| In two (pretty intensive) days, I built a replica Instagram web application in Ruby on Rails     | [InsterGraham] (https://github.com/russellvaughan/instagram-challenge) |
| In just under two weeks, as part of a team of 5, we built a music streaming service with a Angular frontend and rails API.      | [FairMuse](https://github.com/russellvaughan/fairMuse) |   
|In one week, as part of a team of 4, we managed to build a web application that uses the GitHub API to search through its users. This was all done on a new framework and language with AngularJs | [Github Profiler] (https://github.com/russellvaughan/githubProfiles)   |  

#### New Business Development

I love new business development and have found it hugely important that I make an impact on companies I work for.  My experience in bringing new clients on board is a very tangible way to demonstrate that.  When discovering new business, I feel there is something incredibly exciting about seeing if you are able to offer solutions to help solve their unique issues.  My experience has proven to me that there are no real shortcuts to finding new business - you have to work hard and get out to find it.

- I have brought numerous new major advertising clients on board notably the likes of GSK, Mars and Fiat
Understanding that the biggest jobs require a team effort, I was extremely proud to be part of team that took BT from a non-spender to a multi-million pound advertiser
- I was also part of a team that launched Dax, a new digital audio advertising network, in the UK, who, in its first year achieved 75% market awareness and over £1m in advertising revenues
- Previous to my media work, I joined a startup recruitment company with five employees and $100,000 yearly revenues and in just over a year, we scaled that to a 20 person company with $1.4m in revenues.


#### Management Experience

I always look for better and more efficient ways of approaching work. One of the things I loved about managing a team was that it gave me a platform to share some of those processes and instill them throughout the team. Management has also given me more exposure to the higher level workings of a business. I have had the responsibility for weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting to senior management teams. I've also been a part of annual volume/share deal negotiations and have been responsible for their management and implementation. I really love seeing other people succeed and having the responsibility for my team's annual performance reviews allowed me to contribute to their success as well.

- By setting up best practice systems and processes I was able to increase revenue visibility for forecasting by nearly 100% each month.
- By promoting a mentality of proactivity and hard work, the team as a whole performed exceptionally well in 2015 with collective        revenue finishing up 11% YOY.
- Through setting expectations, honest feedback and listening to their ambitions and goals, I was extremely proud to have three of my      team members promoted while working for me.

 A full-time intensive, remote, coding bootcamp. 

Although based in London, a big part of the reason I choose to take part remotely is I that I felt that I would have more time to work harder. Without the commute each day, I could spend that time in front of a computer coding.

- Languages and frameworks used: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Angular.js
